shortened links will follow the format 3ln.me/xxxxxx#xxxxxxx

where the first part is the id, and the second part is the optional decryption key

id is a counter, using the chars 0-9, a-z, A-Z, -, _, ., ~ (66 chars total)

decryption key is configurable length (or optional passphrase), using the same char set for autogen, or full utf-8 (url-encoded) for user-provided

the id is the PK in the database allowing for O(log n) lookups of the smallest available id
